    <h2>Units 1 &amp; 8 – Linear Functions &amp; Geometry</h2>
    <p>
      This unit covers linear functions and geometry, including how to graph lines using slope-intercept and point-slope form. It also explores patterns in arithmetic sequences, as well as how to find distances and midpoints between points. You'll learn how to identify and work with perpendicular lines too.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the slope of a line that is perpendicular to a line with a slope of 2?</p>
